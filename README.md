# Project 1: Quality Education Content Classifier
## Overview
This project demonstrates how to fine-tune a pre-trained NLP model using Hugging Face Transformers
for classifying educational content in alignment with SDG 4: Quality Education. 
The classifier distinguishes between educational content that supports quality education and content that does not.

## Objective
The goal is to train a model that can categorize text into the following classes:
 * Inclusive Education
 * Quality Learning
 * Non-SDG Aligned

 ## Evaluation Metrics
  * Accuracy
  * Precision, Recall, F1 Score

## Result
 Compare model performance before and after fine-tuning to assess improvements.

# Project 2: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure Classifier
## Overview
 This project involves fine-tuning a pre-trained language model to classify text related to SDG 9. 
 The classifier is designed to recognize content related to industrial development, innovation, and infrastructure development.

## Objective
  * Develop a model to classify text into:
  * Infrastructure Development
  * Industrial Development
  * Innovation
  * Non-SDG Aligned

## Evaluation Metrics
   * Accuracy
   * Precision, Recall, F1 Score
## Results
Assess the modelâ€™s performance before and after fine-tuning to identify any improvements.
